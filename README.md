### Development

This repo requires the use of [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/). You can [install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) with:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

Then simply run:

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

This will start up the documentation website.

### Linting

GitHub actions will enforce code quality according to the prettier, eslint, and typescript configuration.

It will also enforce that commit messages follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary). Please familiarize yourself with it if you have not used it before.
